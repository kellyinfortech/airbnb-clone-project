## üîê API Security

Securing our API is essential to protect users, ensure system integrity, and build trust. The following security practices are in place:

### 1. Authentication
- **What it does:** Verifies user or system identity.
- **How it's implemented:** OAuth 2.0 and JWT-based authentication.
- **Why it's important:** Prevents unauthorized access to user data and services.

### 2. Authorization
- **What it does:** Controls access to resources.
- **How it's implemented:** Role-based access control (RBAC).
- **Why it's important:** Ensures users can only access allowed features.

### 3. Rate Limiting
- **What it does:** Limits excessive or abusive requests.
- **How it's implemented:** Middleware and tools like Redis.
- **Why it's important:** Prevents DDoS, brute-force attacks, and ensures fair use.

### 4. Data Encryption
- **What it does:** Secures data in transit and at rest.
- **How it's implemented:** HTTPS for all communication, bcrypt for password hashing.
- **Why it's important:** Protects sensitive data from interception and tampering.

### 5. Input Validation & Sanitization
- **What it does:** Filters and validates incoming data.
- **How it's implemented:** Validation rules at all API endpoints.
- **Why it's important:** Prevents injection attacks (SQLi, XSS, etc.).
